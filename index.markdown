Welcome to the world of Knowledge Graphs, we are working hard on the tutorial so it is ready for [COLING 2022 - The 29th International Conference on Computational Linguistics](https://coling2022.org/), October 12th-17th 2022.


In the meantime why not check out [1st edition of the tutorial](https://kge-tutorial-ecai2020.github.io/) held during ECAI 2020?

##### Peek into the tutorial...

## Abstract
Knowledge graph embeddings are supervised learning models that learn vector representations of nodes and edges of labeled, directed multi-graphs. We describe their design rationale, and explain why they are receiving growing attention within the graph representation learning and the broader NLP communities. We highlight their limitations, open research directions, and real-world use cases. Besides a theoretical overview, we also provide a handson session, where we show how to use such models in practice.
