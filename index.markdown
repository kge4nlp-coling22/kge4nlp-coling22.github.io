Welcome to the world of Knowledge Graphs, we are working hard on the tutorial so it is ready for [COLING 2022 - The 29th International Conference on Computational Linguistics](https://coling2022.org/), October 12th-17th 2022.


In the meantime why not check out [1st edition of the tutorial](https://kge-tutorial-ecai2020.github.io/) held during ECAI 2020?

##### Peek into the tutorial...

## Abstract
Knowledge graph embeddings are supervised learning models that learn vector representations of nodes and edges of labeled, directed multi-graphs. We describe their design rationale, and explain why they are receiving growing attention within the graph representation learning and the broader NLP communities. We highlight their limitations, open research directions, and real-world use cases. Besides a theoretical overview, we also provide a handson session, where we show how to use such models in practice.

## Speakers

**Luca Costabello** is research scientist in Accenture Labs Dublin. His research interests span knowledge graph applications, machine learning for graphs, and explainable AI. He is the creator of AmpliGraph, a Python library for knowledge graph embedding models (1.6k github stars). He organised and co-presented the first edition of the KGE tutorial, co-located with ECAI-20. He led the organization of the first edition of the Explainable AI tutorial at AAAI-199, an event with over 200 attendees. Before joining Accenture, Luca was research scientist at Fujitsu Ireland, PhD student at Inria France, and research engineer at Telecom Italia. Luca co-authored works published in AI and NLP conferences (including ACL and EMNLP) and regularly serves as PC member for flagship conferences.
